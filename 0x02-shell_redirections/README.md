This project is about:
1. Shell I/O Redirections (head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr)
2. Standard input and output redirections.
3. Special characters (white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde and how and when to use them)
4. How to concatenate files and print on the standard output, to reverse a string, to remove sections from each line of files, what the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files do.
